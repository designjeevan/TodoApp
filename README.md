## To-do App - A Kotlin introduction

Learning project in the Kotlin language.

This is my first contact with Kotlin (and Java).

#### Goals
* Gain initial insight into the Kotlin language
* Gain initial insight into the Kotlin workflow
* Avoid using frameworks that obfuscates how Kotlin works (the goals is to LEARN Kotlin not make the code small or super efficient)
* Get a sense for the differences in philosophy compared to Python
* Have a working To-Do app with a browser interface
