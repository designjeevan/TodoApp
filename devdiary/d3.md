### Date 3.0
After a weekend break, time to get back at it. First thing is spending a few minutes getting back on track and seeing what the main goals of the day are. I need to finish up the TaskDAO so I can start working on the "view"/API. I'm also breaking up this dev diary since it's getting pretty big to just leave it on a single readme file.

#### 3.1
Finished up the TaskDAO (at least for these initial features). All I needed to do was implement the completeTask method.

#### 3.2
Started building the API. Since I'm unfamiliar with Javalin I am having to depend and adapt their tutorial, but it seems straightforward enough.
An App is initialized with a Javalin class and some initial configuration is done for error handling. App is started on a chosen port.

The meat of the API happens in the routing configuration where the API endpoints will be defined. In this app these will basically be the "CRUD" methods defined earlier in the TaskDAO.

#### 3.3
Hm... first time running the server and there is a complaint about a missing dependency called 'Jackson'. Conveniently the error message suggests adding this dependency to build.gradle.

#### 3.4
And it works! Beautiful :) That was easy enough... feels like cheating :P
