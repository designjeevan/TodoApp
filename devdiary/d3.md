### Date 3.0
After a weekend break, time to get back at it. First thing is spending a few minutes getting back on track and seeing what the main goals of the day are. I need to finish up the TaskDAO so I can start working on the "view"/API. I'm also breaking up this dev diary since it's getting pretty big to just leave it on a single readme file.
