This exercise brings many new challenges for me. From the language to the development environment. But my main concern is adapting to a statically typed mindset.

Although static typing is now available in Python I have not yet experienced it. The sparse contact I've had with this methodology was in toy projects in the Unity game engine.

After a bit of work I managed to get [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) working on my environment (Arch, makes things harder but teaches you some new things every time).

Using an IDE with so many features is also going to be part of the new experience... I'm mostly used to coding in VIM or at most a barebones Sublime Text. IntelliK seems absolutelly packed with features.

After a few hours skimming through Kotlin introductions, blog posts and videos, my feeling is that 90% of the content is targeted at developers moving from Java to Kotlin. Which makes sense... 

But I feel Kotlin/JetBrains would benefit from having more resources made towards developers who are arriving at Kotlin having other experiences (or none at all).

One good resource I found for Python developers was [this blog post](https://khan.github.io/kotlin-for-python-developers/#constants) by the fine people of Khan Academy.

I have to admit the thought "Why do you do this in such a complicated way" crossed my minds many times when looking at Kotlin/Java code... Python is so elegant and readable in comparison :P

But Kotlin also seems to take a lot from Python and apply it to Java, making it much more appealing to work with than the latter.

I'm experimenting with very simple "Hello World" scripts.

Even tho I don't like the feeling of depending in a 'bloated' IDE, having it validate my code as I go is a very nice experience. 

Static typing (and it's added complexity) are now making more sense to me. I think I get how this is beneficial in larger projects with multiple developers. I see how it could have saved me a world of pain in some projects.
